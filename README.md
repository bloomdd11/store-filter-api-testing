# STORE FILTER API TESTING

I test api with mongodb. So if you want to try it, you have to connect your own cluster then run populate.js before testing anything

Before doing anything run command //-> npm install

1. You have to use your own MongoDB cluster
2. Create .env and store your cluster URI with name "MONGO_URI"
3. Before testig anything, run populate.js
with command //-> node populate
4. After you have done above three steps,
you can start with //-> npm start in your terminal
